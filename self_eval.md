# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
    - The difficulty was with the syntax. Just remembering what symbols go where especially if you are copying some code elsewhere you gotta check the syntax!
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
    - It's going well for me. I have this color coded system so far that helps me hone in on items more easily as I flip back through pages. I want to move these notes onto a digital format so searching is made easier. I have to build time in my schedule for that.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
    - I like to solve things on my own first. If I hit a wall then I try googling. The challenge with google is sifting through all of the search results that come up and you're looking for something very specific.
